Learning object detection from Nicholas Renotte course

Follow the steps provided by Nicholas Renotte
[TFODCourse](https://github.com/nicknochnack/TFODCourse).
However, this repo only works for Linux and a *requirements.txt*
file is available which you can use to install dependencies.
The *requirements.txt* has been generated by `python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

To create the data folders use
```
mkdir -p Tensorflow Tensorflow/workspace Tensorflow/workspace/images Tensorflow/workspace/images/collectedimages Tensorflow/workspace/images/collectedimages/livelong Tensorflow/workspace/images/collectedimages/thankyou Tensorflow/workspace/images/collectedimages/thumbsdown Tensorflow/workspace/images/collectedimages/thumbsup
```

If you want even more information about collecting images to train on look at [labelImg](https://github.com/HumanSignal/labelImg).
